# Smart Service Project: Predictive Maintenance for Volta Limburg

Project Overview:
- This project aims to improve the efficiency of Volta Limburg's technicians by introducing a machine learning model that classifies heating appliance problems as either customer-solvable or technician-required
- Using a random forest algorithm, a system was developed based on prepared data and feature engineering, achieving an accuracy of 71.34%
- The model is designed to reduce unnecessary technician visits, reduce environmental impact through reduced travel and save around â‚¬109,620 per year
- The solution is scalable and can easily be expanded to include new data sources, such as Sqippa sensors
- In addition to the model development, ethical, social and business implications were also considered to ensure a sustainable and customer-oriented implementation
